This is an example of how you can build your site around Markdown files.

Images referenced in Markdown are copied to the generated site, like these kittens:

![Kittens](images/kittens.jpg)

Finally, here's some sample code with beautiful syntax highlighting thanks to PrismJS:

```typescript
function greeting (name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

console.log(greeting('GatsbyJS'))
```
